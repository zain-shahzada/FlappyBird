## Project:
Flappy Hasnaan (Flappy Bird clone)

## Description:
This project is dedicated to understanding the basics of Pygame along with its functions & methods.
I have created a Flappy Bird clone with a little tweaks, mainly in the Sprites, for me to get a 
feel for how it is to code in Python.

## Technologies Used:
- Pygame Library
- Asprite

## How to Run:
1. Confirm Python and Pygame are installed on your machine
2. Download repository
3. Ensure all files from repository are cloned
4. Use Visual Studio Code (preferred) or another editor to run code
